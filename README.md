# 257D
A dual control voltage processor project

The 257D Dual Control Voltage Processor is designed to replicate the functionality of the Buchla 257 module using modern construction techniques and readily available parts.

Additionally, the 257D includes:

* A stable voltage reference to isolate the frequency controls from fluctuations and noise on the power supply rails.
* 
 
There are build options to adjust the function of the module to a particular users requirements.

The repository contains:

* KiCad project files
* Schematic and build/calibration notes as PDF files
* Bill of Materials in ODS and PDF format
* Interactive webpage for matching BOM items to PCB locations
